"It was an excellent class, it was a little complicated due to all the terms of coding that we didnâ€™t know, but still, the teacher made it easier to understand and with his help, we could understand better our assignments and activities. It was a satisfactory course and i'm really happy with the knowledge i take from this class. Hope to have other clases with this professor."
